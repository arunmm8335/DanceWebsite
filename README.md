How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dance-academy.git
cd dance-academy

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

npm install

Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

If your project requires environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string, API keys), create a .env file in the root directory and add your configuration:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=8000

Make sure to replace your_mongodb_connection_string with your actual MongoDB URI.

Step 4: Start the MongoDB Server

Ensure MongoDB is installed and running before starting the backend:

mongod

If you're using MongoDB Atlas (cloud), no need to start mongod, just make sure your database connection string is correct.

Step 5: Run the Application

Start the Node.js server by running:

node app.js

or, if you're using nodemon for automatic restarts during development:

npx nodemon app.js

Step 6: Open in Browser

Now, open your web browser and go to:

http://localhost:8000

If you have changed the port in .env, replace 8000 with your chosen port.

Future Enhancements

Implement user authentication with encrypted passwords.

Add real-time chat support for inquiries.

Improve the UI/UX with animations and modern design elements.
